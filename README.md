# Michael Knapp

Hi, I'm Mike — a software engineer and former military comms specialist turned site reliability engineer. I’ve spent the last decade building, automating, and monitoring infrastructure that supports high-impact systems — from secure expeditionary networks to hyperscale Kubernetes services in the cloud.

These days, I care a lot about:

- Making CI/CD pipelines faster, safer, and more developer-friendly
- Measuring what matters through good telemetry and meaningful SLOs
- Building observable systems that fail loud, rollback fast, and tell good stories in logs and dashboards

I'm currently working on platform-level observability and deployment automation for Azure NetApp Files — a first-party Azure service.

## Selected Projects

### [`Microservice Rollout Monitoring`](https://github.com/knappmi/microservice_rollout_monitoring)
A minimal Kubernetes-based canary deployment setup using Helm, GitHub Actions, and Prometheus. Includes rollback logic based on HTTP error rates and Grafana dashboards for rollout health.

### [`IngrediGuard`](https://github.com/knappmi/IngrediGuard)
A Python-based Kivy (Android) application that allows users to input Menus and parse allergies based on input. Especially useful for commercial establishments that need to easily parse sensitive food items for customers with dietary restrictions.

### [`MLOps Lab`](https://github.com/knappmi/mlops_lab)
A full-stack MLOps pipeline built to support the entire machine learning lifecycle — from data preprocessing to automated model deployment — using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## What I'm Working On

- Exploring OpenTelemetry for deeper request tracing in distributed systems
- Designing resilient pipelines that can pause, retry, and self-heal
- Building a simple self-service platform for test environments
